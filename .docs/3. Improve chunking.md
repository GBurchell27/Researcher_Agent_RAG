1. Improve Chunking Strategy
Your current chunking strategy divides text based primarily on character count (1000 characters with 200 overlap), with some attempt to break at logical boundaries. Here are some improvements:
Semantic Chunking: Instead of purely length-based chunking, implement semantic chunking that preserves the contextual meaning of document sections.

2. Adjust Similarity Threshold and Add Query Expansion
Your MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD is set to 0.7, which might be too high for some queries. Set to 0.5


3. Implement Hybrid Search
Your current system only relies on vector similarity. Implementing a hybrid search approach can significantly improve retrieval:


4. Improve Text Cleaning
Your current text cleaning could be enhanced:




Implementation Plan
Short-term improvements:
Lower the similarity threshold to catch more potentially relevant results
Implement query expansion to increase retrieval coverage
Improve the chunking strategy to better preserve semantic meaning
Medium-term improvements:
Implement re-ranking to better sort retrieved chunks
Add a hybrid search approach combining semantic and keyword search
Enhance text cleaning to handle PDF extraction artifacts better
Advanced improvements:
Implement Maximum Marginal Relevance for diverse results
Consider using a smaller chunk size with higher overlap
Implement document-level embeddings alongside chunk embeddings
These enhancements should significantly improve the relevancy of chunks returned for your queries, especially for questions where the answer is in obvious places like the first page.
