1) User uploads PDF
   - **PDF Reception**: The user uploads a PDF file through the frontend interface.
   - **Document Processing**: The system:
     - Extracts text from all pages of the document using PyMuPDF
     - Cleans and normalizes the text (removing excess whitespace, fixing encoding issues)
     - Chunks the text into manageable segments (default 1000 characters with 200 character overlap)
     - Creates text chunk objects with metadata including page numbers, positions, and document info

2) PDF is cut into chunks and stored in Pinecone
   - **Embedding Generation**: Text chunks are converted to vector embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model (1536-dimensional vectors)
   - **Vector Database Storage**: The system:
     - Creates a Pinecone index if it doesn't exist already
     - Upserts chunk embeddings along with their metadata
     - Organizes vectors by document using namespaces
     - Maintains metadata like document ID, chunk position, and page number

3) user asks question
   - **Query Reception**: User submits a question through the frontend
   - **Query Embedding**: The system generates an embedding vector for the user's question

4) pine cone provides chunks of text similar to the question
   - **Similarity Search**: The query processor:
     - Uses the query vector to search Pinecone for similar text chunks
     - Filters results using a similarity threshold (default 0.7)
     - Ranks chunks by relevance score
   - **Context Assembly**: The system:
     - Retrieves the most relevant chunks (default top 5)
     - Assembles these chunks into a coherent context
     - Organizes them by relevance and original page order
     - Removes duplicative content

5) relevant chunks + user question is passes to ChatGPT 4o to answer said question
   - **AI Response Creation**: The response generator:
     - Combines the user query with the retrieved context
     - Constructs a well-formatted prompt for ChatGPT 4o
     - Includes instructions to synthesize information from the context
     - Retrieves a comprehensive answer that cites specific parts of the document

6) response displayed to user
   - **User Interface**: The system:
     - Returns the generated response to the frontend
     - Displays the answer to the user
     - Potentially includes citations, page references, and confidence levels
     - May offer related questions or follow-up options

## Additional System Features
- **Document Management**: Users can see previously uploaded documents and delete them if needed
- **Session Tracking**: The system maintains user sessions to organize documents
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for invalid files, failed queries, etc.
- **Performance Optimization**: The system tracks and optimizes response times
