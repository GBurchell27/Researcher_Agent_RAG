- [✅] Develop text chunking algorithm with configurable chunk size and overlap
- [✅] Add basic validation for uploaded files (file size, format)
- [✅] Implement error handling for malformed or unreadable PDFs
- [✅] Create data structures to track extracted chunks and their source locations

### ✅2.2 Frontend File Upload
- [✅] Design and implement PDF upload component in Streamlit
- [✅] Add file selection and upload button
- [✅] Implement progress indicators for upload process
- [✅] Display confirmation when PDF processing is complete
- [✅] Show extracted document statistics (pages, chunks, etc.)
- [✅] Add error handling for failed uploads

### ✅2.3 Text Processing Refinement
- [✅] Optimize chunking strategy for better semantic coherence
- [✅] Implement text cleaning to handle common PDF extraction issues
- [✅] Create methods to maintain context across chunks (e.g., section headings)

## Phase 3: Embeddings & Pinecone Integration

### ✅3.1 Embeddings Generation
- [✅] Implement OpenAI API client wrapper in embeddings.py
- [✅] Create batch processing for efficient embedding generation
- [✅] Add retry logic for API rate limits and failures
- [✅] Implement caching to avoid regenerating embeddings for the same text

### 3.2 Pinecone Setup
- [ ] Initialize Pinecone index with appropriate dimensions
- [ ] Configure metadata structure to store:
  - Original text chunks
  - Source page numbers
  - Document identifiers
  - Timestamps
- [ ] Implement vector_store.py with methods for:
  - Upserting vectors
  - Querying by similarity
  - Deleting vectors
  - Namespace management for multiple documents

### 3.3 Integration Layer
- [ ] Create document processing pipeline connecting extraction to embedding generation to storage
- [ ] Implement document tracking to associate chunks with source documents
- [ ] Add session management to handle different user uploads in the same instance
- [ ] Create methods to clear or reset the vector store

### 3.4 Testing Vector Storage
- [ ] Verify embedding dimensions match Pinecone index configuration
- [ ] Test similarity search with various query types
- [ ] Measure retrieval latency and optimize if needed
- [ ] Validate metadata retrieval works correctly

## Phase 4: Query Handling & AI Response

### 4.1 Query Processing
- [ ] Implement query embedding generation
- [ ] Create similarity search logic to retrieve relevant chunks
- [ ] Develop context assembly to combine retrieved chunks
- [ ] Implement relevance filtering to exclude low-similarity results

### 4.2 Response Generation with Pydantic AI
- [ ] Define Pydantic models for structured query and response formats
- [ ] Implement query_handler.py to orchestrate the Q&A process
- [ ] Create prompt templates for different query types
- [ ] Add mechanisms to cite sources in responses
- [ ] Implement fallback handling for when no relevant context is found

### 4.3 Frontend Chat Interface
- [✅] Design and implement chat interface in Streamlit
- [✅] Create message display with user/assistant distinction
- [✅] Implement query input and submission
- [✅] Add loading indicators for query processing
- [ ] Format response display with citations/references
- [✅] Implement chat history storage

### 4.4 Enhancing Response Quality
- [ ] Add prompt engineering to improve answer relevance
- [ ] Implement answer confidence scoring
- [ ] Create mechanisms to handle uncertain responses
- [ ] Add support for follow-up questions with context preservation

## Phase 5: Refine UI & Testing

### 5.1 UI Improvements
- [ ] Polish styling and layout for better user experience
- [ ] Add responsive design elements
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Create help section with usage instructions
- [✅] Add document management features (list uploaded documents, switch between them)

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize backend API performance
- [ ] Implement client-side caching where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize embedding generation with batching
- [ ] Improve vector search efficiency

### 5.3 Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] Implement feedback mechanism for responses

### 5.5 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update all documentation with final implementation details
- [ ] Create user guide with examples
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Prepare deployment instructions

## Deployment Considerations

### Local Deployment
- [ ] Document local setup process
- [ ] Create startup scripts for both backend and frontend
- [ ] Add instructions for environment configuration

### Cloud Deployment Options
- [ ] Document deployment to Streamlit Sharing
- [ ] Provide guidelines for deploying backend to services like Render, Heroku, or Railway
- [ ] Include notes on managing API keys securely in cloud environments

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

- Supporting additional file formats (DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- User preferences and customizations
- Performance enhancements for larger documents
- Integration with citation management tools
- Export functionality for conversations
